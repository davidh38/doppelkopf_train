* Game Data Flow

This document describes the data flow in the Doppelkopf game application, including the API routes, WebSocket events, and the sequence of interactions between the frontend and backend.

** Game Flow Sequence

The game follows these steps in order, with the corresponding API routes:

1. *Start a New Game*: Click the "New Game" button to create a new game session
   - API Route: =/new_game= (POST)
   - Creates a new game instance with a unique ID
   - Initializes the game state with default values
   - Returns the game ID to the client

2. *Select a Game Variant*: Choose from Normal, Hochzeit (Marriage), Queen Solo, Jack Solo, or Fleshless
   - API Route: =/set_variant= (POST)
   - Parameters: game_id, variant, player_idx
   - Sets the chosen variant for the specified player
   - When all players have chosen, determines the final game variant based on priority
   - Transitions the game from variant selection phase to card play phase

3. *Play Cards*: Take turns playing cards by clicking on them when it's your turn
   - API Route: =/play_card= (POST)
   - Parameters: game_id, card_id
   - Validates if the move is legal
   - Updates the game state with the played card
   - Handles trick completion if all players have played a card
   - Triggers AI players to take their turns

4. *Make Announcements (Optional)*: 
   - If you're on the Re team (have Queens of Clubs), you can announce "Re"
   - If you're on the Kontra team (no Queens of Clubs), you can announce "Contra"
   - If you have both Queens of Clubs, you can announce "Hochzeit" (Marriage)
   - Announcements must be made before the fifth card is played
   - API Route: =/announce= (POST)
   - Parameters: game_id, announcement
   - Validates if the announcement is legal
   - Updates the game state with the announcement

5. *Complete Tricks*: The highest card in each trick wins and collects points
   - Current trick info: =/get_current_trick= (GET)
   - Last trick info: =/get_last_trick= (GET)
   - When a trick is completed, points are calculated and added to the winner's team score
   - Special rules like Doppelkopf bonus and Diamond Ace capture are applied

6. *Game Ends*: After all cards are played, the team with more points wins
   - Scoreboard: =/get_scoreboard= (GET)
   - When all cards have been played, final scores are calculated
   - The winner is determined (Re team needs at least 121 points to win)
   - Game points are awarded to players based on the outcome

7. *View Summary*: See the final score and game statistics
   - API Route: =/game-summary/<game_id>= (GET)
   - Displays detailed information about the game outcome
   - Shows points earned, special achievements, and game points awarded

** WebSocket Events

Socket.IO provides real-time updates during gameplay, showing AI player moves and trick completions automatically. The main WebSocket events include:

1. *game_update*: Sent when the game state changes
   - Contains the complete game state for the client to render
   - Includes information about current player, hands, tricks, scores, etc.

2. *ai_selecting_variant*: Sent when an AI player is selecting a game variant
   - Parameters: player, variant
   - Used to show the variant selection animation for AI players

3. *ai_playing_card*: Sent when an AI player plays a card
   - Parameters: player, card
   - Used to show the card playing animation for AI players

4. *trick_completed*: Sent when a trick is completed
   - Parameters: winner, points, cards
   - Used to show the trick completion animation and update scores

5. *game_over*: Sent when the game ends
   - Parameters: winner, scores, summary
   - Used to show the game over screen with final results

** Data Flow Diagram

The data flow between components follows this general pattern:

1. User Interface (Frontend)
   - Renders the game state
   - Captures user inputs (card selection, variant choice, announcements)
   - Sends requests to the backend via API calls or WebSocket events

2. Backend Server
   - Processes requests from the frontend
   - Validates game rules and legal moves
   - Updates the game state
   - Manages AI player decisions
   - Sends updates to connected clients via WebSocket

3. Game Logic
   - Implements the rules of Doppelkopf
   - Determines legal actions
   - Calculates scores and determines winners
   - Handles special rules and variants

4. AI Logic
   - Makes decisions for AI players
   - Selects game variants
   - Chooses cards to play
   - Makes announcements based on hand strength and game state

** API Routes Reference

** State Management

The game state is managed on the server and includes:

1. *Game Information*
   - Game ID
   - Current phase (variant selection, card play)
   - Current player
   - Game variant
   - Whether the game is over

2. *Player Information*
   - Hands (cards held by each player)

The state is updated after each action and sent to all connected clients to keep the UI in sync with the game state.
